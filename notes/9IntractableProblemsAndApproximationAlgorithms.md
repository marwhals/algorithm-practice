# Intro

- Section is for techniques for proving that no efficient algorithm exists for a given problem
  - *Motivation* Why are you better off knowing that something you don't know how to do in fact can't be done at all?
  - *NP-Completeness* very useful as always although providing negative results
    - Allows for focusing efforts productively, knowing that certain efforts may just lead to failure
- When one *fails* to show a problem is hard there may be an efficient algorithm to solve it.
  -Theory of NP-Completeness enables us to identify what problems make a particular problem "hard"

## Fundamental concept
- Use concept of reductions between problems showing that the problems are really equivalent. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

### Overview of the chapter
- Reductions, either yields an efficient algorithm *or* such an algorithm cannot exist.
  - Includes complexity theoretic aspects of NP-Completeness
  - *The theory of approximation algorithms* - things that lead to a close to optimal solution.
